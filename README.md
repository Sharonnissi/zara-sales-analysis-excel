# Zara Sales Analysis Dashboard | Excel

##  Project Overview
I did this project to analyze Zara's clothing sales dataset to uncover trends, understand the impact of promotions, and provide my recommendations to improving sales.  

**Key business questions answered:**
- Which are the top-selling products?
- Do promotions increase sales?
- Which product sections (MAN/WOMAN) perform better?
- How do seasonal products perform compared to non-seasonal?
